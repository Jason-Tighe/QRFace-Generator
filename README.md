# QRFace-Generator
Created with CodeSandbox


Things I'm able to make a QR code for:

-URL's
-Phone numbers
-Pdf's/Images
-Google Docs

Still needs to test things such as files and mp3's

Business Card?
SMS?
Bitcoin?
WIFI?
Email?


So I know how I'm going to go about these, the question is whether or not I can do this with a free subscription to mongoDB, maybe I should look at alternatives.
